- I could not scroll up and down and select the options. I researched it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55753151/cant-use-arrow-keys-in-git-bash-windows) but all the things I tried did not seem to work for me, the most popular options were using git bash in my VSCode, that did not work, I kept getting an error, and deleting the >, but that also did not work. A TA did try it and said it was working, take that for what you will.
